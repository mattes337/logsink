# LogSink Service Test Suite

This directory contains comprehensive tests for all LogSink service endpoints, focusing on issue creation, embedding functionality, and deduplication.

## Test Files Created

### 1. `endpoints.test.js` - Complete Endpoint Test Suite
A comprehensive test suite covering all LogSink service endpoints:

- Custom timestamp handling
- Input validation (missing applicationId, message)
- Screenshot processing in context
- Retrieve logs by application
- Empty application handling

**Log State Management:**
- State transitions: open â†’ in-progress â†’ done â†’ revert

**Embedding Functionality and Deduplication:**
- Log creation with pending state when embeddings enabled
- Embedding status and pending count
- Force processing of embeddings
- Text-based search functionality
- Similar log detection
- Message-based deduplication (reopening done issues)

**Cleanup Service:**
- Cleanup status and configuration
- Manual cleanup triggering
- Running state validation

**AI-Powered Endpoints:**
- Log analysis with AI
- AI suggestions for fixes
- Application summary generation
- AI service unavailability handling

**Error Handling and Edge Cases:**
- Invalid log IDs
- Invalid state transitions
- Malformed JSON requests
- Large context objects
- Concurrent log creation

### 2. `core-functionality.test.js` - Focused Core Tests
A simplified test suite focusing on the core functionality:

**Issue Creation:**
- Basic issue creation with embedding support
- Issue deduplication logic
- State management
- Application statistics

**Embedding Features:**
- Pending state for new issues
- Embedding status retrieval

### 3. `debug.test.js` - Authentication Debug Tests
Simple tests to debug authentication issues:
- Health check without auth
- API key validation
- Bearer token support

## Key Features Tested

### Issue Creation and Deduplication
- **New Issue Creation**: Tests verify that new issues are created with proper state (pending when embeddings enabled, open otherwise)
- **Deduplication Logic**: When an issue with the same message is created and a previous issue with that message exists in 'done' state, the system reopens the existing issue instead of creating a new one
- **Reopen Count**: Tracks how many times an issue has been reopened
- **Context Merging**: When reopening, contexts are merged and screenshots are combined

### Embedding Functionality
- **Pending State**: New issues start in 'pending' state when embeddings are enabled
- **Background Processing**: Tests verify embedding generation and processing workflows
- **Similarity Detection**: Tests embedding-based similarity detection for advanced deduplication
- **Text Search**: Vector-based search functionality using embeddings

### State Management
- **State Transitions**: Comprehensive testing of valid state transitions
- **State-based Retrieval**: Tests for getting issues by state (open, in-progress, done, revert)
- **Invalid Transitions**: Proper error handling for invalid state changes

### Worker Integration
- **Open Issues**: Workers can retrieve open issues to start working on them
- **In-Progress Tracking**: Issues can be marked as in-progress when workers start
- **Completion**: Issues can be marked as done with completion metadata (git commit, statistics)
- **Reversion**: Completed issues can be reverted if fixes cause regressions

## Test Configuration

### Environment Setup
```javascript
// Test environment configuration
process.env.NODE_ENV = 'test';
process.env.API_KEY = 'test-api-key-123';
process.env.GEMINI_EMBEDDING_ENABLED = 'true';
process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY = 'test-gemini-key';

// Override config for testing
config.server.apiKey = testApiKey;
config.embedding.enabled = true;
config.embedding.apiKey = 'test-gemini-key';
```

### Mocking Strategy
- **Embedding Service**: Mocked to return consistent test embeddings
- **Background Processor**: Mocked for controlled testing
- **AI Services**: Mocked responses for analysis and suggestions
- **Database Cleanup**: Automated cleanup between tests

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test tests/endpoints.test.js
npm test tests/core-functionality.test.js

# Run with specific timeout
npx mocha tests/core-functionality.test.js --timeout 15000
```
